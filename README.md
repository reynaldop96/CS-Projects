# CS-Projects
This repository contains some of the computer programming projects I did in my programming courses in college:

1) Closest Pairs Algorithm in time complexity O(nlogn)
2) Modified Dijkstra's Shortest Paths Algorithm
3) Sorting Algorithms
4) Modified Splay Tree using intervals as nodes
5) Tasmanian Devil Disease Simulation
