  **Tasmanian Devil Project**
  
  The instructions for the project were as follows: 
 	Write classes to complete a simulation of devils moving around a hex-grid world infecting 
	each other with devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). A world will be specified by the width of the 
	grid (the height should be chosen so that the world is roughly square in terms of Cartesian coordinates),
	the total number of devils in it, and the number of devils initially infected with DFTD. Each devil moves 
	around the world by randomly chosing a location on the grid and moving one hex closer to its target during 
	each step of the simulation. When a devil reaches its goal, it randomly chooses another goal. When two 
	devils are at the same location and one of them is infected with DFTD and the other is not, there is an 
	80% chance that the other devil becomes infected (if more than two devils are at the same location, this 
	interaction should be repeated for each pair of devils).
